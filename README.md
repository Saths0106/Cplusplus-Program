# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
I created an app that utilized Java code created by someone else to allow a user to create a file containing a database about zoo animals and add or remove animals from that database. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did well creating for loops that iterated through a vector, which is a little more difficult to get right in C++ than I'm used to in Java. I also feel creating a while loop that negates incorrect user input was clever, although I don't know how well that idea would scale with a larger program. 

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part for me really was writing the for loops that iterated through a vector due to the diffences between that and java. Part of that was because vector.size() returns an unsigned int which can create problems if compared with a int and it is not very good code to do it that way. I have one such example in my code because it did not and will not cause issues with my code, but I did find different ways to do it as I wrote different parts of the program. I overcame this by using google, as I usually do with any problem, and reading through how other people fixed similar issues with their code. I find this is a great way to learn because I'm looking at and understanding how other people wrote their code and learning about several different options to fix the problem, some working with my code and some not working with my code. 

# What skills from this project will be transferable to other projects and/or coursework? 
I'm certain at some point in my programming career I will have to use two or more programming languages to create a program. Currently I believe the big ones are Java and Python together because Python is quite efficient at certain small tasks and data processing but it is helpeful to learn how to call Java code into a C++ program and to understand how it works. I wish we had delved more into it as I will most certainly need a refresher before I use it again, but I've found that's coding in general. Everything I know how to do well I only know how to do because I've done it many times, and I always have to re-lookup information when I've only worked with something once or twice. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I learnt when I first started coding that I should try to keep my code as readable as possible. I try to keep brackets indented to the same level so I can tell what bracket belongs to what block of code, I try to re-write unnecessarily large blocks of code into smaller more efficient blocks, and I use comments to let the reader, or myself later on, understand what my code is supposed to do in plain english.
